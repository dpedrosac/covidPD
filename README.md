## About this Project
- In this project we consider the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of Parkinson's patients in Germany.
- The underlying data was collected using a questionnaire designed in the international Parkinson network and also issued in partner countries.
- We ask which predictors can be found to identify patients who are most likely to be affected by the COVID- 19 pandemic in a negative way.
- This knowledge can help to prevent worsening of healthcare access of those vulnarable groups in similar settings and in general.
- Therefore we developed a code to help us analyze the data.


## Technologies Used

## Acknowledgements
- The database of this project was collected by an questionnaire designed by Eric Crighton, PhD (Professor, Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics, University of Ottawa and Tiago Mestre MD, MSc (Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, University of Ottawa)
- The questionnaire was available from 11/24/2020 - 01/03/2021 via SoSci Survey
- The questionnaire was shared via the e-mail distribution list of the German Parkinson Society (https://www.parkinson-vereinigung.de/wir-ueber-uns.html), later the questionnaire was also sent to smaller regional groups who asked for it.
