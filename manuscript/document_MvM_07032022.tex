	\section*{Background}
	The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event for people within the last few generations. The uncontrolled spread of a virus causing potential fatal side effects despite maximal intensive care therapies and the consecutive necessity to reduce everyday life has afflicted Western societies economically, culturally but obviously also within healthcare systems. In an attempt to spare societies from far worse, everyday world almost ceased with rising incidences and public access to almost all services was limited to the most basic needs. All the measures taken to prevent worse left those particularly exposed, who may not be vitally at harm but whose well-being may heavily rely on intact social functioning.

People suffering from chronical illnesses attain more freqently to non-emergency medical services and were therefore at high risk of undersupply during the pandemic. Numerous studies have unveiled the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronically-ill patients \cite{olivieri2021auswirkungen, ceglaeinfluss}. At the same time the need to remain at home brought up many examples of solidarity but has also enabled Western societies to rapidly evolve in terms of remote medical solutions. This was only hampered in its efficiency given the lack of validated tools. In neurology, one may have inferred that subjects particularly prone for undersupply would be those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. 

People with Parkinson's disease (PwP) suffer from a progressive condition which manifests with considerable heterogeneity. Motor and non-motor symptoms may develop during the course of PD requiring continuous adjustments and therefore regular visits assessments by healthcare professionals. It remains to be elucidated whether restrictions of offered services may have striken PD-patients more profundly, as only a limited number of studies have this far been conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PwPs in Germany \cite{zipprich2020knowledge, frundt2022impact, richter2021analysis}. These studies focus on personal behaviour, knowledge and access to specialized therapies. A recent study by FrÃ¼ndt et al. investigated the impact of the pandemic on PwPs general healthcare situation with a specific focus on long-term care \cite{frundt2022impact} and contrary to one might expect posit that deficits in health care were less severe than expected \cite{frundt2022impact}. Given the good performance of the German healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic, these results do not come as surprise \cite{10665-341674}. %den Satz wÃ¼rde ich in die Diskussion packen%
	
	However, studies from other areas of public health research show, that the effect of public health crisis are not universal but affect some individuals more than others \cite{huijts2017prevalence, lowcock2012social}. This inequality can be explained by so-called  social determinants of health (SDH). SDH are non-medical factors that influence, among other things, peoples access to healthcare. The link between SDH and individuals access to healthcare is observable with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, which means that some population groups experienced greater impacts than others based on their SDH \cite{whocovidbrief}.
	
	There are several conceptualizations and definitions of what SDH are but in a broadest sense, they compromise contextual, structural and individual factors \cite{world2010conceptual}. The word \textit{contextual} is of utmost importance here: what may be considered as relevant SDH is not universal. For the context of Parkinson's disease, Zaman  et al. proposed a model which summarizes structural and individual factors that may influence PwPs access to healthcare \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	Structural SDH in this model may be reflected by barrieres, that PwPs meet on a system-level when trying to access healthcare, such as a lack of care coordination, limited communication between healthcare providers, disparities in health services or the unavailability of specialit services \cite{zaman2021barriers}. Individual SDH may be reflected by personal barriers in this model, which influence the PwPs ability to seek help, engage with care providers, reach important care services or pay for them \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	
	To the best of our knowledge, it has not been investigated how SDH may explain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PwPs access to healthcare. Therefore, we here explicitly examine the impact of relevant SDH on PwPs access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The basis of our analysis is the German dataset of an anonymous survey that was carried out as part of the iCARE-PD project. In the iCARE-PD project, international collaborators are seeking ways to improve health care for PwP by establishing integrated care models. These models are characterized by a patient-centered approach with coordination of local healthcare providers and application of technology-based solutions \cite{fabbri2020moving}.  
	
. had profound impact on the accesibility of medical services. In order to learn from the pandemic in the long term, difficulties in access to healthcare must be uncovered and addressed \cite(iyengar2020learning). Although numerous studies in Germany analyze %weiÃŸ nocht nicht so genau, wie ichb das einbringen wÃ¼rde. Ist aber wichtig!%


\section*{Methods}
The study was approved by the local Ethics committee (AZ??) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave informed written consent prior to participating. The study is registered under the study ID DRKS00025764 in the German Clinical Trial Register. %In what way was consent achieved in the online survey?%.

This study, which was developed within the iCARE-PD project, aimed at characterizing the access of PwP to healthcare services and at identifying barriers to be addressed. Therefore, a survey consisting of four parts was developed originally in English: A) questions describing the patients' health status (in terms of PD but also concomitant diseases), B) questions regarding experiences with health care services within the 12 months before the pandemic, C) questions addressing experiences with healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic and also the use of telemedicine services before, and, D) devoted to ascertain the demographic background of participants (a full version of the questionnaire can be encountered in the supplementary material). The questionnaire included 49 items with single, multiple choice questions or open-ended quesions, some of which depended upon the specific answers on previous ones. In addition to Germany, the questionnaire was also delivered in Canada, Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic with the respective translations. In this study, we limit ourselves to data collected from German patients.

The invitation to participate in the German translation of the survey was sent via the e-mail list of the German Parkinson's Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Parkinson und BewegungsstÃ¶rungen, DPG). All patients who had received the diagnosis of PD were addressed and were allowed to particpate anonymously via the online platform SoSci Survey (Quelle??) from November 2020 to January 2021. Participation was possible via a computer as well as by cell phone. %who did the translations with which program, if any?

\subsection*{Additional data}
All participants were asked to disclose the first three numbers of their German postal code, allowing for regional containment of the data. We concatenated the resulting data with publicly available population densities (https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/forschung/raumbeobachtung/Raumabgrenzungen/deutschland/regionen/Raumordnungsregionen/raumordnungsregionen-2017.xlsx?\_\_blob=publicationFile\&v=3) and those for family doctors and neurologists (source: https://gesundheitsdaten.kbv.de/cms/html/16402.php). Manual changes were necessary for major cities in which many postal codes may be available (cf. https://github.com/dpedrosac/covidPD/blob/main/preprocess\_geospatial\_data.r). Maps for the densities for neurologists and family doctors as well as the one for the available questionnaires (cf. \ref{fig1:total}) could be created by merged available data for postal codes (https://www.suche-postleitzahl.org/downloads). 
Moreover, participants were asked to provide information to concomitant diseases besides PD. This information was concatenated to a score of comorbidities for which we used the ElixhÃ¤user Comorbitiy Score, modified by van Walraven \cite {van2009modification}, which indicates more severe diseases by higher values. Finally, predictions were grouped according to previously characterized barriers to accessing health services regarding PwP\cite {zaman2021barriers}. Briefly, 

\subsection*{Statistical analyses}
All analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team (2021), Quelle R). For the available questionnaires (n = 552), descriptive statistics were estimated (cf. \ref{tab1:demographics}). Consecutively, satisfaction with overall PD-related care was compared before (Question B6: ) and during the pandemic (Question B6: ) using a non-parametric sign-test (rstatix packages Quelle??). Furthermore, logistic regression investigated prognostic factors (for en entire list cf. supplementary material) of PD-patients' overall perception of care during the pandemic. After establishing the full model, a stepwise logistic regression was conducted in order to extract the most meaningful predictors for question C4 ( %Bitte ausformulieren, auch weiter oben). 
Fur that purpose, first missing data was imputed taking advantage of a multivariate imputation scheme using the MICE package (Quelle??). We thereby assumed data being missing at random and used the predictive mean matching method (PMM). After finishing imputation, a stepwise reduction enabled by the caret package using the glmStepAIC function aimed at maximising the AIC by reducing potential predictors in both directions. Accuracy served as the metric and the model was estimated at 80\% of the data and validated at the resting 20\%. All analyses are available under https://github.com/dpedrosac/covidPD/

\section*{Results}
In total, 551 questionnaires were filled out with 252 different postal codes stemming from all 17 regions (BundeslÃ¤nder, cf. Figure~\ref{fig1:total}A). Of all participants, 388 returned a complete questionnaire (70.4$\%$). Demographics from parts A and D are displayed in Table~\ref{tab1:demographics}.

There was a significant decrease in satisfaction with PD-related care during the pandemic. Hence, the sign-test for the question: %bitte ergÃ¤nzen % 
indicated significantly lower values during the pandemic (Mdn = 1) compared to before (Mdn= 3, \textit{p} = 10\textsuperscript{-73}) with more than 90\% of all participants indicating to be "rather unsatisfied" or "very unsatisfied" with their PD-related care during the pandemic (cf. Figure \ref{fig2:satisfaction}). To ascertain reasons why satisfaction was so low during the \textsc{COVID}-19 pandemic, we conducted logistic regressions on question ?? (""). Thereby different factors could be identified contributing to the perception of an unmet neet for services furing the pandemic (cf. \ref{fig3:resultsOR1}). Thus there was a highly significant odd of unmet needs during pandemic for those patients who inferred lower level of competence in their neurologist, with a lower ability to access PD-care before the onset of the pandemic, higher degrees of stigmatisation in healthcare and thos who did not receive healthcare services before the pandemic (all ps $<$ .001). Significant albeit lowers odds for iPS-patients unmet needs for healthcare services could be encountered with increasing levels of comorbidity, perceived lower expertise of the GP, higher PDQ-8 scores, higher financial burden due to PD or rescheduled healthcare due to financial burden before the pandemci but also less availability of remote healthcare during the pandemic or geopgraphical or more numerous barriers in general before start of the pandemic (p$<$.05). A graphic overview for significant predictors can be encountered in Figure \ref{fig3:resultsOR1} and the entire list of results is summarised in the supplementary material. % LInk einfÃ¼gen.

	In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
	addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
	importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
	studies of escape dynamics.
	We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
	some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
	%
	\[
	E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]=
	\int_0^{v\wedge
		1}Z_0(uT_x)
	\exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
	\]
	%
	If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
	$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
	$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
	estimate the expected value as
	%
	\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
		\begin{aligned}[b]
			&      E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]\\
			&\quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
			\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
