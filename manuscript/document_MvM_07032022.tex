	\section*{Background}
	The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event for people within the last few generations. The uncontrolled spread of a virus causing potential fatal side effects despite maximal intensive care therapies and the consecutive necessity to reduce everyday life has afflicted Western societies economically, culturally but obviously also within healthcare systems. In an attempt to spare societies from far worse, everyday world almost ceased with rising incidences rose and public access to almost all services was limited to the most basic needs, leaving those particularly exposed, who may not be vitally at harm but whose well-being may heyvily rely on intact social functioning.

People suffering from chronical illnesses attain more freqently to non-emergency medical services and were therefore at high risk of undersupply during the pandemic. Numerous studies have unveiled the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronically-ill patients \cite{olivieri2021auswirkungen, ceglaeinfluss}. Yet, at the same time the need to remain at home has brought up many examples of solidarity but has also enabled societies to rapidly evolve in terms of remote medical solutions only hampered in their efficiency as not many validated tools existed before. In neurology, subjects particularly prone for undersupply were thos suffereing from neurodegenerative disease and particularly Parkinson's disease %Kann man das mit einer Quelle belegen?%. 

. had profound impact on the accesibility of medical services. In order to learn from the pandemic in the long term, difficulties in access to healthcare must be uncovered and addressed \cite(iyengar2020learning). Although numerous studies in Germany analyze %weiÃŸ nocht nicht so genau, wie ichb das einbringen wÃ¼rde. Ist aber wichtig!%


People with Parkinson's disease (PwP) suffer from a progressive condition showing a great heterogeneity. Motor, as well an non-motor symptoms may develop so that tailored treatment options and continuous adjustments are necessary. One may therefore infer, that restrictions of healthcare services may have striken those patients at a very high level. Surprisingly, only a limited number of studies have this far examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PwPs in Germany \cite{zipprich2020knowledge, frundt2022impact, richter2021analysis}. These studies focus on personal behaviour, knowledge and access to specialized therapies. A recent study by FrÃ¼ndt et al. investigated the impact of the pandemic on PwPs general healthcare situation with a specific focus on long-term care \cite{frundt2022impact} and contrary to one might expect posit that deficits in health care were less severe than expected \cite{frundt2022impact}. Given the good performance of the German healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic, these results do not come as surprise \cite{10665-341674}. %den Satz wÃ¼rde ich in die Diskussion packen%
	
	However, studies from other areas of public health research show, that the effect of public health crisis are not universal but affect some individuals more than others \cite{huijts2017prevalence, lowcock2012social}. This inequality can be explained by so-called  social determinants of health (SDH). SDH are non-medical factors that influence, among other things, peoples access to healthcare. The link between SDH and individuals access to healthcare is observable with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, which means that some population groups experienced greater impacts than others based on their SDH \cite{whocovidbrief}.
	
	There are several conceptualizations and definitions of what SDH are but in a broadest sense, they compromise contextual, structural and individual factors \cite{world2010conceptual}. The word \textit{contextual} is of utmost importance here: what may be considered as relevant SDH is not universal. For the context of Parkinson's disease, Zaman  et al. proposed a model which summarizes structural and individual factors that may influence PwPs access to healthcare \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	Structural SDH in this model may be reflected by barrieres, that PwPs meet on a system-level when trying to access healthcare, such as a lack of care coordination, limited communication between healthcare providers, disparities in health services or the unavailability of specialit services \cite{zaman2021barriers}. Individual SDH may be reflected by personal barriers in this model, which influence the PwPs ability to seek help, engage with care providers, reach important care services or pay for them \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	
	To the best of our knowledge, it has not been investigated how SDH may explain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PwPs access to healthcare. Therefore, we here explicitly examine the impact of relevant SDH on PwPs access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The basis of our analysis is the German dataset of an anonymous survey that was carried out as part of the icare-PD project.   
	
\section*{Methods}
The study was approved by the local Ethics committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave informed written consent prior to participating.

\subsection*{Participants}


\section*{Results}
In total, 552 questionnaires were filled out with 252 different postal codes. Further demographics are listed in Table~\ref{tab1:demographics}. With respect to the distribution of the questionnaires, participants were located at all regions in Germany (cf. Figure~\ref{fig1:questionnaires}

One of our primordial analyses, was to analyze how the satisfaction with PD-related care had evolved during the pandemic. For that purpose we asked the participants,$?$ %bitte ergÃ¤nzen % 
A sign-test thereby indicated significantly lower values during the pandemic (Mdn = 1) compared to before (Mdn= 3, \textit{p} = 10\textsuperscript{-73}). More than 90\% of the participants thereby indicated to be "rather unsatisfied" or "very unsatisfied" with their PD-related care during the pandemic (cf Figure \ref{fig2:satisfaction}).

\end{figure}

 Consecutively, for we could identify a series of predictors that significantly increased the odds that patinets affirmed the question that healthcare services would have been needed but were necessities were not met during the pandemic. HIgh significance was encountered for the factors: perceived expertise of the neurologist, the lack of ability to access PD-care before the pandemic, the experienced stigmatisation in healthcare, difficulties to acess healthcare services before the pandemic and the lack of PD-related care before the pandemic (all p $<$ .001). A graphic overview for significant predictors can be encountered in Figure \ref{fig3:resultsOR1} and the entire list of results is summarised in the supplementary material. % LInk einfÃ¼gen.

	In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
	addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
	importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
	studies of escape dynamics.
	We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
	some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
	%
	\[
	E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]=
	\int_0^{v\wedge
		1}Z_0(uT_x)
	\exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
	\]
	%
	If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
	$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
	$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
	estimate the expected value as
	%
	\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
		\begin{aligned}[b]
			&      E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]\\
			&\quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
			\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
