\section*{Background}
	The \textsc{Covid}-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event for people within the last few generations. The uncontrolled spread of a virus causing potential fatal side effects despite intensive care and the consecutive necessity to reduce everyday life has afflicted Western societies economically, culturally but obviously also within healthcare systems. In an attempt to spare societies from far worse, with rising incidences everyday world almost ceased and public access to services was limited to the most basic needs. All the measures taken to prevent worse, left those particularly exposed who may not be vitally at harm but whose well-being rely heavily on intact social functioning.

	People with chronical illnesses attain more freqently to non-emergency medical services and seemed therefore at high risk of undersupply during the pandemic. Numerous studies have unveiled the impact of the \textsc{Covid}-19 pandemic on chronically-ill patients \cite{olivieri2021auswirkungen, ceglaeinfluss}, who remained homebound to avoid innecessary exposure and thus hinged upon their surroundings' solidarity. At the same time this pandemic has not least shown the janus-headed nature of remote medical solutions: On the one hand, because we healthcare providers in Western societies have had to get used to making diagnoses and discussing therapies from afar in a hurry. Otherwise, because it has revealed our hitherto inadequate means for safe, stable but especially widely available remote solutions. In neurology, one may have inferred that subjects particularly prone for undersupply would be those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases according to the chronical nature of the diseases but also due to mobility restrictions. 

	Patients suffering from \ac{pd} show a progressive condition characterized by motor but also non-motor symptoms. A plethora of different clinical signs may emerge during the course of \ac{pd} and may require continuous therapy adjustments and needs assessments by healthcare professionals. There is no solid evidence on whether restrictions of offered services may have striken \ac{pd}-patients more profundly, according to the limited number of studies conducted so far \cite{zipprich2020knowledge, frundt2022impact, richter2021analysis}. However, studies from other areas of public health research indicate very indicidual affection of public health crisis \cite{huijts2017prevalence, lowcock2012social}. With regard to \ac{pd}-patients individual symptoms may play an important role, but more generally, this inequality can also be explained by so-called \ac{sdh}. \ac{sdh} are non-medical factors that influence, among other things, peoples access to healthcare. The link between them and individuals access to healthcare is observable with regard to the \textsc{Covid}-19 pandemic, which means that some population groups experienced greater impacts than others based on their \ac{sdh} \cite{whocovidbrief}.

	The is no universal conceptualisation of what \ac{sdh} imply. In a broadest sense, they comprise contextual, structural and individual factors \cite{world2010conceptual} associated with health. The word \textit{contextual} is of utmost importance here: what may be considered as relevant \ac{sdh} is by no means universal. For \ac{pd}, Zaman  et al. proposed a model summarising structural and individual factors potentially influencing affected patients' access to healthcare \cite{zaman2021barriers}. Structural \ac{sdh} may thereby be reflected by barrieres, that \ac{pd}-patients meet on a system-level when accessing healthcare, such as a lack of care coordination, limited communication between healthcare providers, disparities in health services or the unavailability of specialised services \cite{zaman2021barriers}. Individual \ac{sdh}, in turn, may be reflected by personal barriers in this model, influencing \ac{pd}-patients' abilities  to seek help, engage with care providers, reach important care services or pay for them \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	
	To our knowledge, it has not yet been investigated how \ac{sdh} may relate to the \textsc{Covid}-19 pandemic on PD-patients' access to healthcare. Therefore, we examined the impact of a multitude of factors on people suffering from \ac{pd} with special emphasis on their access to healthcare during the pandemic in Germany. This analysis relies on an anonymous survey carried out as part of the \ac{icarepd}-project (\url{https://icare-pd.ca/}).

 \cite{zipprich2020knowledge, frundt2022impact, richter2021analysis}. These studies focus on personal behaviour, knowledge and access to specialized therapies. A recent study by FrÃ¼ndt et al. investigated the impact of the pandemic on PwPs general healthcare situation with a specific focus on long-term care \cite{frundt2022impact} and contrary to one might expect posit that deficits in health care were less severe than expected \cite{frundt2022impact}. Given the good performance of the German healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic, these results do not come as surprise \cite{10665-341674}. %den Satz wÃ¼rde ich in die Diskussion packen%
	
had profound impact on the accesibility of medical services. In order to learn from the pandemic in the long term, difficulties in access to healthcare must be uncovered and addressed \cite(iyengar2020learning). Although numerous studies in Germany analyze %weiÃŸ nocht nicht so genau, wie ichb das einbringen wÃ¼rde. Ist aber wichtig!%

	There are several conceptualizations and definitions of what SDH are but in a broadest sense, they compromise contextual, structural and individual factors \cite{world2010conceptual}. The word \textit{contextual} is of utmost importance here: what may be considered as relevant SDH is not universal. For the context of Parkinson's disease, Zaman  et al. proposed a model which summarizes structural and individual factors that may influence PwPs access to healthcare \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	Structural SDH in this model may be reflected by barrieres, that PwPs meet on a system-level when trying to access healthcare, such as a lack of care coordination, limited communication between healthcare providers, disparities in health services or the unavailability of specialit services \cite{zaman2021barriers}. Individual SDH may be reflected by personal barriers in this model, which influence the PwPs ability to seek help, engage with care providers, reach important care services or pay for them \cite{zaman2021barriers}. 
	
	To the best of our knowledge, it has not been investigated how SDH may explain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PwPs access to healthcare. Therefore, we here explicitly examine the impact of relevant SDH on PwPs access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The basis of our analysis is the German dataset of an anonymous survey that was carried out as part of the iCARE-PD project. In the iCARE-PD project, international collaborators are seeking ways to improve health care for PwP by establishing integrated care models. These models are characterized by a patient-centered approach with coordination of local healthcare providers and application of technology-based solutions \cite{fabbri2020moving}.

\section*{Methods}
The study was approved by the local Ethics committee (AZ??) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave informed written consent prior to participating. The study is registered under DRKS00025764 in the German Clinical Trial Register (\url{}). %In what way was consent achieved in the online survey? TODO: Seid ihr sicher, dass die Studie registriert ist beim DRKS?! Ich finde nichts...

A questionnaire with 49 items was developed within the \ac{icarepd}-project and aimed at characterising the access of \ac{pd}-patients to healthcare services but also at identifying barriers to be addressed. The questionnaire was developed in English and consisted of four different parts: A) questions describing the patients' health status (in terms of \ac{pd} but also the concomitant diseases), B) questions regarding experiences with healthcare services within the twelve months before the pandemic, C) questions addressing experiences with healthcare services during the \textsc{Covid}-19 pandemic with special emphasis on the use of telemedicine services, and, D) questions devoted to ascertain demographic backgrounds of participants. There were single, multiple choice questions or open-ended quesions, some of which depended upon the specific answers on previous ones. A full version of the questionnaire is included in the supplementary material. In addition to Germany, the questionnaire was also delivered in Canada, Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic with the respective translations. In this study, we limit ourselves to data collected from German patients. 

The invitation to participate in the German translation of the survey was sent via the e-mail list of the German Parkinson's Association \ac{dpg}. All patients who had received the diagnosis of \ac{pd} were addressed and were allowed to particpate anonymously via the online platform SoSci Survey (Quelle??) from November 2020 to January 2021. Participation was possible via a computer as well as by cell phone. %who did the translations with which program, if any? TODO: Sind wir sicher, dass es die DPG und nicht die DPV war?!

\subsection*{Additional data}
All participants were asked to disclose the first three numbers of their German postal code, allowing for regional data containment. We concatenated resulting data with publicly available population densities (\url{https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/forschung/raumbeobachtung/Raumabgrenzungen/deutschland/regionen/Raumordnungsregionen/raumordnungsregionen-2017.xlsx?\_\_blob=publicationFile\&v=3}) and those for family doctors and neurologists (\url{https://gesundheitsdaten.kbv.de/cms/html/16402.php}). Merging the available data with the maps for postal codes ((\url{https://www.suche-postleitzahl.org/downloads})) resulted in maps (cf. Figure \ref{fig1:total}) from which data for population densities and number of neurologists per 100.000 could be extracted and fed into further analyses. Moreover, participants were asked to provide information of concomitant diseases (besides \ac{pd}. This information was concatenated to a score, the ElixhÃ¤user Comorbitiy Score, modified by van Walraven \cite{van2009modification} in which higher values indicate more severe disease burden. Finally, all questions were grouped according to previously characterized barriers to accessing health services regarding \ac{pd} \cite{zaman2021barriers}.

\subsection*{Statistical analyses}
All analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team (2021), \cite{rcore}). After descriptive statistics were estimated, satisfaction with overall \ac{pd}-related care was compared before (Question B6: ) and during the pandemic (Question ??: ) using a non-parametric \textit{sign-test} (rstatix packages Quelle??). Furthermore, logistic regression analysed prognostic factors of \ac{pd}-patients' overall perception of care during the pandemic. After establishing the full model, a stepwise logistic regression was conducted in order to extract the most meaningful predictors for question C4 ( %Bitte ausformulieren, auch weiter oben). 
Fur that purpose, first missing data was imputed taking advantage of a multivariate imputation scheme using the \textsc{Mice}-package (Quelle??). We thereby assumed data missing at random and used the \ac{pmm}. After finishing imputation, a stepwise reduction enabled by the \textit{caret}-package using the \textit{glmStepAIC} function aimed at minimising the \ac{aic} by reducing potential predictors in both directions. Accuracy served as the metric and the model was estimated at 80\% of the dataset and validated at the resting 20\%. All analyses are available under \url{https://github.com/dpedrosac/covidPD/}

\section*{Results}
In total, 551 questionnaires were filled out with 252 different postal codes from all 17 German regions (BundeslÃ¤nder, cf. Figure~\ref{fig1:total}A). Of all participants, 388 (70,4$\%$) returned a complete questionnaire (for demographics from parts A and D of the questionnaire cf. Table~\ref{tab1:demographics}).

There was a significant decrease in satisfaction with PD-related care during the pandemic. Hence, the sign-test for the question: %bitte ergÃ¤nzen % 
indicated significantly lower values during the pandemic (Mdn = 1) compared to before (Mdn = 3, \textit{p} = 10\textsuperscript{-73}) with more than 90\% of all participants stating to be ``rather unsatisfied'' or ``very unsatisfied'' with their \ac{pd}-related care during the pandemic (cf. Figure \ref{fig2:satisfaction}). To ascertain underlying reasons for this dramatic decline of satisfaction, we conducted logistic regressions on question C4 (``Did you need healthcare but did not receive it?''). Thereby, different factors could be identified contributing to the perception of an unmet neet for services during the pandemic (cf. Figure \ref{fig3:resultsOR1}). Thus odds to affirm this question were highly significant higher (\textit{p} $<$ .001) for those patients inferring lower levels of competence for their neurologist, with a lower ability to access \ac{pd}-care before the pandemic, for patients with higher degrees of stigmatisation in healthcare and for those who did not receive healthcare services before the pandemic. Significantly higher, albeit lowers, odds were encountered for \ac{pd}-patients' with increasing levels of comorbidity, with perceived lower expertise of the \ac{gp}, with higher PDQ-8 scores retrospectively, for people with higher financial burden due to \ac{pd} or who rescheduled healthcare due to financial burden before the pandemic. Finally, lack of availability of remote healthcare during the pandemic and geographical or in general more numerous barriers before start of the pandemic were also indicative of higher odds to perceive unmet needs (all \textit{p}$<$.05).

	In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
	addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
	importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
	studies of escape dynamics.
	We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
	some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)

	\int_0^{v\wedge
		1}Z_0(uT_x)
	\exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
	\]
	%
	If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
	$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
	$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
	estimate the expected value as
	%
	\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
		\begin{aligned}[b]
			&      E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]\\
			&\quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
			\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	%
	Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
